# EECS592-tictactoe
Project to solve a tictactoe board using the minimax algorithm. The opponent places pieces randomly while the minimax algorithm chooses the next best possible move by minimizing loss. 

## Build requirements
This project was developed and tested on Python 2.7. There are no external packages.

## Usage
Run ```tictactoe.py``` and specify the random seed. 

# Outputs
Each subsequent tictactoe board will be printed in a 3x3 grid with ```x```, ```o```, and ```-``` characters.
