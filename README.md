# EECS592-tictactoe
Project to solve a tictactoe board using the minimax algorithm. The opponent places pieces randomly while the minimax algorithm chooses the next best possible move by minimizing loss. 

## Build requirements
This project was developed and tested on Python 2.7. The only external package needed is ```numpy```

## Usage
Run ```tictactoe.py``` and specify the random seed. 

# Outputs
After the program finishes, output will be in ```suoutput.txt```. Output is a 9x9 matrix.
